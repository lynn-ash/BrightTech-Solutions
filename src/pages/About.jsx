                            team members. Before becoming what it is today, the team asked 
                            themselves one simple question: How can we help other businesses 
                            reach their full potential? This could manifest itself in the form 
                            of popularity, effciency, or their overall impact on society. At its
                            core, that is what BrightTech Solutions is.
